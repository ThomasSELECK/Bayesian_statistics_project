# Bayesian statistics project - The Calculation of Posterior Distributions by Data Augmentation

## How does this repository works
 - The folder src contains all the source code of the project (here, Python 3.5 code).
 - The folder doc contains the documentation (the report we need to do for this project, in Latex format and pdf).
 - The folder project_management contains everything we need to manage the project (meetings summaries, ...).
 - The folder legacy contains the original paper and the project subject.
 
## Code and documentation guidelines
 - Make sure you write your code (variables names) and comments in english
 - Only use MEANINGFUL variables names (except for 'for' loop variables where you can use a simple letter as an iterator (e.g. "for i in range(10)")
 - Write your documentation in english using Latex.
 
## Have fun!
